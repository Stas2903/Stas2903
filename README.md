## About me:

I am a Data Science student at Hanyang University with a wide range of hard and soft skills. During my projects, I use a combination of programming and research skills with a range of background and domain-based knowledge to deal with real-world data. And provide valuable insights using analytical skills to consequently build the predictive models to forecast the target and finally deploy the predictive model. I have experience in data analytics, data visualization, data manipulations, building ML and DL models including ANN, CNN, and RNN, building pipelines, and also using various techniques and applications for deploying the trained models. I believe that my skills and huge experience working in a team make me a compitable specialist for any inspired team. I am constantly developing my skills and exploring new applications and techniques to keep up with world trends and contribute to the Data Science and AI communities.

Thanks for your time spent getting to know me better.
